Question 2: What is the difference between checked and unchecked exception?

Answer:

    Checked Exceptions are the exceptions that runs on compile time and checks that you handle these exceptions.
    Must be handled: Either with a try-catch block or by declaring them with the 'throws' keyword in the method fucntion.
    Require to be explicitly managed in your code.

    Example: IOException, SQLException


    Unchecked exceptions occur during runtime and not checked at compile time.
    Does not need to declare 'throws' keyword in the method fucntion or handle in try catch.
    Unchecked exceptions don't require explicit management, but you can handle them if you want to.

    Example of Unchecked Exceptions:  NullPointerException, ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
